    "# Q3. In what situations is nominal encoding preferred over one-hot encoding? Provide a practical example.\n",
    "# Ans 3:Nominal encoding is preferred over one-hot encoding when the categorical variable has a large number of unique categories. One-hot encoding\n",
    "# creates a separate binary feature column for each unique category, which can result in a very high-dimensional feature space, especially \n",
    "# if the categorical variable has many unique values. This can lead to computational and memory issues, as well as the\n",
    "# \"curse of dimensionality\" problem where the number of features grows exponentially with the number of unique categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "# In contrast, nominal encoding maps each unique category to a unique integer value, effectively reducing the dimensionality of the \n",
    "# categorical variable to a single column. This can be more efficient in terms of memory usage and computation time, especially when the \n",
    "# number of unique categories is large.\n",
    "\n",
    "# A practical example where nominal encoding may be preferred over one-hot encoding is in natural language processing (NLP) applications,\n",
    "# such as sentiment analysis. In NLP, it is common to represent text data using bag-of-words or bag-of-ngrams models, where each word or \n",
    "# ngram is treated as a separate feature. However, there can be many unique words or ngrams in a large text corpus, leading to a very \n",
    "# high-dimensional feature space if one-hot encoding is used. In this case, it may be more practical to use nominal encoding to map \n",
    "# each word or ngram to a unique integer value, and then use these integer values as input features for a machine learning model.\n",
    "\n",
    "# For example, consider a sentiment analysis task where we want to predict the sentiment of movie reviews. The input data consists of\n",
    "# a large corpus of text, and each movie review is labeled as either positive, negative, or neutral. Instead of using one-hot encoding \n",
    "# to represent each word as a separate feature, we can use nominal encoding to map each word to a unique integer value. This can be done\n",
